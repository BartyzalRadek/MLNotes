 - faces alone do not show emotion
 - affect = simple VS emotion = more complex
 - simple feelings = un/pleasant = body tells us something is wrong != emotion
 - what we call emotion can be considered illness (nostalgia VS depression)
 - machines do not need emotions but simple feelings because the emotions differ in different cultures, some do not feel sad
 - affects = simple feelings = properties of consciousness = feeling good/bad/calm/hungry = regulation of body = keeping it alive
 - infants can't regulate their bodies = cannot predict needs of the body and fulfill them = somebody else does it for them = they learn
 - words teach infants abstract concepts = same word implies same concept even if the objects are different
 - reward = getting the system (body) to normal => simple feelings arise => from them complex feelings
 - = everything arises from the brain trying to regulate the body
 - can't make brains bigger => allow other brains to regulate our nervous system = thats why we are social animals = we need other people, loneliness = die 7 years sooner
 - need for balance VS need for novelty = exploration VS exploitation = expend energy to get reward
 - depression = we expended too much energy without reward = the brain decides it does not want to expend more energy
