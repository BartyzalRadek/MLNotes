### Statistical Learning (Vladimir Vapnik)

**Instrumentalism** = science is useful for prediction = just laws for prediction

**Realism** = science describes objective truth = find God's laws = true everywhere

 - for understanding I need conditional probability, for prediction I need a model
 - math is the language used by God
 - math shows the truth VS human intuition = misleading fantasy
 - intuition used to create new axioms = integral wisdom of humanity
 - imagination = only our **interpretation** of reality which can be wrong

 **Great teacher** = what makes a great teacher?
 - teacher know reality = chooses what information to give you to help you solve the task
 - good teacher introduces a good invariant (predicate) which greatly reduces the number of admissible functions = reduces the VC dimension = diversity of admissible functions
 - "looks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck" - saying jumps like a duck does not add information - it is a legal predicate but it is useless
 - now in ML we use a lot of data = we do not choose good predicates - but "good" relies on what we already know - "jumps like a duck" does not help, because we know that birds don't jump
 - ML = take space of possible function - I reduce it to an admissible set of function by using training data
 - admissible set of functions has VC dimension = small = still infinite number of functions but not that diverse = I am able to pick up the best function using only small amount of predicates = training examples
 - intelligence = finding the special predicates that help us reduce the set of possible functions the most = reduce the VC dimension of the admissible set of functions
 - VC dimension: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/Classes/ML10715_2015Fall/slides/VCdimension.pdf

Notes:
 - How to find the good predicates? How to reduce the training data? - Interesting connection to Dataset Distillation: https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10959v1
 - The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences: http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~johnda/Papers/wignerUnreasonableEffectiveness.pdf
 - Invariance = the rule is true under all condition = it is invariant

### How the brain creates emotions (Lisa Feldman Barrett)

 - faces alone do not show emotion
 - affect = simple VS emotion = more complex
 - simple feelings = un/pleasant = body tells us something is wrong != emotion
 - what we call emotion can be considered illness (nostalgia VS depression)
 - machines do not need emotions but simple feelings because the emotions differ in different cultures, some do not feel sad
 - affects = simple feelings = properties of consciousness = feeling good/bad/calm/hungry = regulation of body = keeping it alive
 - infants can't regulate their bodies = cannot predict needs of the body and fulfill them = somebody else does it for them = they learn
 - words teach infants abstract concepts = same word implies same concept even if the objects are different
 - reward = getting the system (body) to normal => simple feelings arise => from them complex feelings
 - = everything arises from the brain trying to regulate the body
 - can't make brains bigger => allow other brains to regulate our nervous system = thats why we are social animals = we need other people, loneliness = die 7 years sooner
 - need for balance VS need for novelty = exploration VS exploitation = expend energy to get reward
 - depression = we expended too much energy without reward = the brain decides it does not want to expend more energy
